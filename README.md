Powershell Script that restores Local Services for Calais, helps CAC work

Military CACs require certain permissions to run, especially the Calais folder in the Windows registry. I could not get my Local Services user to stay for the Calais folder on restart. After a few Google searches, I pieced together this small script that I can run every time I want to use a CAC on my personal computer. 

May have been a more permanent solution, but I couldn't find one that was as easy to understand and code myself.
